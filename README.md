# RUBY CAPSTONE: TREASURY

In this project, I was asked to use ruby for scraping websites and to get information. I decided to get info of ruby gems from rubygems.org. The project is capable of fetching gems right from your terminal.The gems query lists a table of gems sorted on downloads. You can select any gem from the table, scroll between gems, install them, uninstall them,view ri documentation if any or automatically open the website for the gem in the browser all right from one simple menu. Now you can view available gems for your next passion project.

## Project Features

- Search for ruby gems right from your terminal.
- Table menu listing fetched gems for easy selection.
- Table sorted on downloads for easy decision making.
- Critical information such as version and downloads.
- Easily select any gem from the list or option to search again.
- Gem Menu for the Ruby Gem where you can easily install or uninstall the gem.
- Short description for the gem.
- View Additional information from ri documentation for the gem from the terminal and open the rubyorgs.org gem documentation in a browser window.
- Scroll between gems.
- Intuitive menus for the ruby gem and table of gems for easy selection and navigation.
